# GradeCalculator
This repository includes a web interface for a grade calculator application that I created during Summer 2017. It includes a main page for logging in and creating an account. Once logged in, a user can create semesters and classes inside of those semesters. When a user creates a class, they must enter information about that class, such as name, number of credits, grading scale, whether grades are based on a points or weighted system, and all the categories and weights of those categories (if it is a weighted system). Inside of a class, users can add and remove grades. To add a grade, users must provide the assignment name, points earned, points possible, and grade category (if it is a weighted system). Final grades are updated instantaneously for the user to view and asynchronously saved into the MySQL database. A particularly helpful feature on the grades page is the ability to calculate a minimum grade a user needs to receive on an assignment (given the assignment's point value or category along with the user's goal percentage for the class) in order to attain a certain percentage/grade in the class. Another key feature on the main page is the ability of the user to view their transcript, which includes all of the user's semesters, classes within those semesters, final grades and number of credits for those classes, semester GPA, and overall GPA.
